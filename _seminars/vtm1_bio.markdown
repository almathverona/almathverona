How mathematical models can reveal and explore emergent phenomena that would otherwise remain unobserved and poorly understood: population dynamics and numerical simulations based on real experimental data.

The seminar is conducted by *Valeria Caliaro* and *Giada Fiandaca*. They will talk about how mathematical models can reveal and allow the exploration of emergent phenomena that would otherwise remain unobserved and poorly understood by looking at population dynamics and numerical simulations based on real experimental data.

* **Valeria** is a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at Laboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions, Sorbonne Universit√©, and is part of the team MAMBA at Inria Paris. Her PhD project concerns the mathematical modelling of regenerative processes in axolotl spinal cord.
* **Giada** is a PhD student in Mathematics at the Politecnico di Torino and at the University of Torino. Her PhD project aims at describing the behavior of biological systems with advanced mathematical tools from both the qualitative and the quantitative point of view.
